def align_sample_batch_annotations(entity: SampleBatch) -> SampleBatch:
    """Align per-image annotation counts (bboxes/labels/masks/keypoints) in place.

    Many detection and instance-segmentation criteria concatenate a sample's
    per-image ``boxes``, ``labels`` and ``masks`` and require their counts to
    match:

    * DETR-style models (RF-DETR, RT-DETR, DEIM/D-FINE, DEIMv2) feed them to a
      Hungarian matcher that adds per-target cost matrices element-wise. A count
      mismatch raises ``RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (N) must match the
      size of tensor b (M) ...`` deep inside the matcher.
    * mmdet-based models (Mask R-CNN, RTMDet-Inst, ATSS, SSD, YOLOX) build
      ``InstanceData`` which enforces that all instance-level fields share the
      same length. For mask heads, positive proposals are matched to ground
      truth by *box* IoU and the resulting index set is used to gather *masks*
      (``gt_masks[pos_assigned_gt_inds]``); if a sample has more boxes than
      masks this indexes out of range and triggers a CUDA device-side assert.

    The data pipeline should already guarantee consistent counts, but geometric
    transforms can drop one annotation type without dropping the paired ones.
    In particular, tiling filters bounding boxes (``BboxTiler``) and instance
    masks with *independent* criteria — boxes by their stored (e.g. COCO)
    coordinates and masks by their rasterised pixels — so an instance straddling
    a tile boundary can be kept for one field and dropped for the other, leaving
    ``len(boxes) != len(masks)``.

    When counts diverge this helper realigns the affected image and logs a
    warning so training degrades gracefully instead of crashing inside the loss.

    Alignment strategy (only applied to images whose counts actually diverge —
    the common consistent path is left completely untouched):

    * **Instance segmentation** (masks present): the masks are treated as the
      source of truth. Every field is trimmed to the common minimum count and
      the boxes are then *recomputed from the (trimmed) masks*. This guarantees
      ``box[i]`` is exactly the tight bounding box of ``mask[i]``, preserving the
      box→mask correspondence the Mask R-CNN mask head relies on. Blindly
      trimming boxes to the first ``n`` entries would instead risk pairing
      ``box[i]`` with a *different* instance's mask when a middle instance was
      dropped from only one of the two fields.
    * **Detection / other** (no masks): each field is trimmed to the common
      minimum count (boxes and labels are produced in the same instance order,
      so trimming trailing extras keeps them aligned).

    Args:
        entity: The batch to align. Modified in place.

    Returns:
        The same ``entity`` instance (for convenient chaining).
