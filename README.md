### Key features

<details>
<summary>🏋️‍♂️ Interactive Model Training </summary>
Intel® Geti™ enables users to start building computer vision models with as few as 10-20 images and iterate on those models with the help of domain experts. The algorithm selects samples from the dataset that help the model learn quickly and achieve high accuracy while reducing the sample biases and the number of data inputs required from the human expert (Active learning).

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 Smart Annotations </summary>
Smart annotations in Intel® Geti™ enable users to easily create bounding boxes, rotated bounding boxes, segmentation boundaries, and more. These smart annotation features coupled with the AI-assisted annotations and state-of-the-art AI models such as the Segment Anything Model keep human experts in the loop while massively reducing the total annotation efforts needed by a human.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🤖 Visual Prompting </summary>
With Intel® Geti™ Visual Prompting workflow, users can prompt a model with only a single annotation. Utilizing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643">the Segment Anything Model from Meta AI</a>, the Visual Prompting workflow further accelerates the time-to-model for our users by providing state-of-the-art innovation.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎨 Multiple Computer Vision Tasks </summary>
Intel® Geti™ supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.geti.intel.com/docs/user-guide/learn-geti/computer-vision-tasks/ai-fundamentals-tasks">multiple computer vision tasks</a> that are commonly employed across various use cases: object detection, rotated object detection, classification, segmentation, anomaly-based tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>⛓️ Task Chaining </summary>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.geti.intel.com/docs/user-guide/learn-geti/computer-vision-tasks/task-chaining-project">Chaining multiple tasks</a> (such as detection and classification) enables Intel® Geti™ users to develop a more granular model and collaborate more effectively across teams. This way users can decouple sequential models to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks and simultaneously create multiple, specialized models rather than forcing a single model to learn every aspect of the task at hand.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🎯 Model Evaluation </summary>
Intel® Geti™ provides users with comprehensive statistics to assess model’s performance and run live tests. Intel® Geti™ executes model testing to evaluate the model performance on unseen data to ensure that the model is fit for purpose for the real-life deployment setup.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🚀 Production-Ready Models </summary>
Intel® Geti™ outputs optimized deep learning model for the OpenVINO™ toolkit to run on Intel® architecture CPUs, GPUs and VPUs or models in PyTorch* format.

## 🛫 Getting Started

Intel® Geti™ can be deployed either on a local machine, on-premises, or on a virtual machine. Intel® Geti™ software uses Kubernetes to orchestrate various component services. The client front end uses HTTP protocol to connect to the platform, so users can access the software through a web browser.

Intel® Geti™ can be installed:

- [Using the Intel® Geti™ Installer](https://docs.geti.intel.com/docs/user-guide/getting-started/installation/using-geti-installer)
- [Using Helm Charts](https://docs.geti.intel.com/docs/user-guide/getting-started/installation/using-helm-charts)
- [Advanced Installation](https://docs.geti.intel.com/docs/user-guide/getting-started/installation/advanced-installation)

## 🏗️ High-level architecture

Intel® Geti™ is a cloud-native distributed system architecture comprising interactive microservice and AI workflows. Most components of Intel® Geti™ adhere to the microservice architecture style, while some components, such as active learning, follow the service-based architecture style. Additionally, event-driven architecture is utilized for asynchronous communication between components.
The core subsystems of Intel® Geti™ are:

- **Platform Services and K8S deployment**: provides basic services (identity and access management, logging and observability), serves as an abstraction layer over the infrastructure services.
- **Workflows & Interactive Microservices**: enables seamless workflows from dataset management to model training, optimization, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Intel® Geti™ Deep Learning Frameworks**: implement modern ML development stack to support computer vision datasets management, training, evaluation, optimization and deployment ML models, end-to-end inference API, Visual explanation for OpenVINO models and anomaly detection library.
