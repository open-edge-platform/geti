                IDs of the labels to apply to the video. Uses the format of a json decodable string. 
                The label id's could be found from the response of the [project detail](#Projects/GetProjectInfo) endpoint. 
                Labels are applied to all video frames at 1 fps. 
                Example: *{\"label_ids\":[\"613776cec8223e455a88383d\", \"613776cec8223e455a88383e\"]}*.
