  summary: Start uploading a dataset archive using TUS
  description: |-
    Initiate a new TUS session to upload a dataset archive.
    
    This endpoint creates a new upload resource on the server according to the TUS protocol (https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html).
    The client provides metadata such as file size and name in the request headers, and the server responds with a location URL for the newly created resource.
    This URL is used for subsequent upload operations (e.g., PATCH, HEAD).
