  description: |-
    Upload a chunk of the dataset archive data to the server, appending it to the TUS upload at the specified offset.

    This endpoint allows the client to resume uploading data with TUS by sending the remaining data from the last known offset.
    It is recommended to choose a large chunk size (based on server limitations) to speed up the overall upload operation.
