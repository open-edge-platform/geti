  summary: Create a new project from a prepared dataset
  description: |-
    Finalize the creation of a new project from an imported dataset, that has been previously uploaded and prepared.

    This endpoint submits a job to create a new project with a given project name, task type and labels, that will also
    contain all the media and annotations from the imported dataset.
    The status of this operation can be monitored in real-time through the [job status endpoint](#Jobs/GetJob);
    once the job is finished, the id of the created project can be found in the job metadata.
