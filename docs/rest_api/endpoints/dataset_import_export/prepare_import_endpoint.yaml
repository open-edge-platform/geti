  summary: Prepare a dataset to be imported as a new project
  description: |-
    Analyze an uploaded dataset archive file and prepare it to be imported as a new project.

    This endpoint submits a job to prepare the dataset for import. Specifically, the job scans the dataset 
    to determine the compatible task types and to identify potential issues in the data.
    The status of this operation can be monitored in real-time through the [job status endpoint](#Jobs/GetJob);
    once the job is finished, the list of compatible task types, labels and warnings can be found in the job metadata.
