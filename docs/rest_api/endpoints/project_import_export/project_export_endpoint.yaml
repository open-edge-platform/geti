  summary: Export a project as an archive
  description: |-
    Export a project as a zip archive file, containing all the project data (including datasets and models).
    
    This endpoint submits a job to export a project.
    The status of the export operation can be monitored in real-time through the [job status endpoint](#Jobs/GetJob); 
    after it completes, the URL to download the exported zip archive can be found in the job metadata.
    
    The downloaded project archive can be later imported using the [import project endpoint](#Project%20Import%2FExport/ImportProject).
