  summary: Import a project from an uploaded archive
  description: |-
    Create a project by importing a project archive file.
    
    The project archive file must be first uploaded using the TUS protocol,
    by means of the [TUS upload endpoints](#Project%20Import%2FExport/CreateTusProjectUpload).
    
    This endpoint submits a job to import a project from the uploaded archive.
    The status of the import operation can be monitored in real-time through the [job status endpoint](#Jobs/GetJob);
    after it completes, the id of the imported project can be found in the job metadata.
