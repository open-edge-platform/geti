  summary: Create a project
  description: |-
    Create a project in a workspace. Please refer to the schema to see all the supported tasks and please refer to the examples to see how
    the project is constructed. At the moment, Geti supports projects with a single deep learning task, or with two in a 
    chain (Detection -> Classification and Detection -> Segmentation).
    A few label constraints:  
    - Detection projects must have at least 1 label provided.
    - A default 'No object' label is automatically created for detection and segmentation tasks. 
    - Classification projects require at least two labels (top-level, if hierarchical). For binary classification, please declare the negative label explicitly.
    - A default 'No class' label is automatically created for classification tasks if there are no exclusive groups with 2+ labels. In practice, multilabel classification has the empty label, multiclass classification does not.
    - Anomaly project must either have 2 labels provided (one being is_anomalous), or no labels provided.
