  summary: Get information on all models and their groups belonging to a project
  description: |-
    Get information on all model groups in a project. Each model group represents one model architecture that has been trained in the project and
    contains a list of successfully trained models of that architecture. 
    To obtain more detail on each of the model version, please use the [model detail](#Models/GetModelDetail) endpoint. 
  operationId: GetModelGroups
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../parameters/path/organization_id.yaml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/path/workspace_id.yaml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/path/project_id.yaml'
    - in: query
      name: task_id
      description: |- 
        Provide the task ID to get the model groups related to that task. For example in a task chain project, 
        set this parameter to the ID of the first task if you are interested only in the model groups of the first task. 
        The task ID can be found in the response body of the [project detail](#Projects/GetProjectInfo) endpoint.

        If no task id is provided, the response will contain the model groups for all tasks in the project.
