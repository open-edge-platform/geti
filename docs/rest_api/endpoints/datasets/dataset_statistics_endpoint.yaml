      description: |- 
        Provide the task ID to get the statistics specifically for that task. For example in a task chain project, 
        if you are interested only in the statistics of the first task, you need to specify the ID of the first task. 
        The task ID can be found in the response body of the [project detail](#Projects/GetProjectInfo) endpoint.

        If no task id is provided, the response will contain statistics for all tasks in the project.
