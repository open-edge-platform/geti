  summary: Create an annotation for a video frame
  description: |- 
    Create a user annotation for a video frame. The user annotation scene contains multiple annotations, each of which is defined by a geometric shape and a
    list of labels for that shape. The shape is defined in pixels.
  operationId: CreateVideoFrameAnnotation
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../parameters/path/organization_id.yaml'

          Classification (or anomaly) annotation: 
            description: |-
              For tasks that do not depend on the geometric shape of the annotations, such as classification or anomaly tasks, the annotations are defined 
              in a specific way, depending on the project. In a single-task project, the annotations will contain a single rectangle shape covering the full image. 
              While in task chain, the classification labels are attached to the geometric shape of the preceding task.
