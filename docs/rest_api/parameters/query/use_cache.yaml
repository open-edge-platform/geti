  This parameter defines the origin of the predictions.  

  When `use_cache=always`, the predictions are pulled from the database cache. If no prediction with the desired configuration exists in the
  cache, a 'not found' respones will be returned. 
  
  When `use_cache=never`, the predictions are generated on the fly based on the request. Note that, the predictions are generated using
  the OpenVINO model with FP32 precision with XAI. This model can be found under the [model detail](#Models/GetModelDetail) endpoint.  
  
  When `use_cache=auto`, the system will first attempt to retrieve an existing prediction for the media item from the
  cache. If no prediction with the desired configuration exists in the cache, a new prediction will be generated on the
  fly. By default, `auto` is used.
