description: "The ID of the ROI to predict on. Can only be an ID of a user annotated ROI. Note that if you pass an ID
for an ROI you should in most cases also pass a task_id. For example, in a detection -> classification chain if a user 
annotates a ROI (box for first task) and requests a prediction for this ROI you don't want the detection task to have to
find the same object again that the user annotated but immediately skip to the classification task."
