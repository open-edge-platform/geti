    description: "Overall state obtained aggregating the annotation states
      with the 'revisit' information on a per-task basis. This only has meaning for an 
      image/frame/scene, as a video does not have an annotation scene.
      - Image/VideoFrame/AnnotationScene:
        - to_revisit: Some annotations need to be revisited by the user for this task
        - annotated: All the ROIs for this task are annotated (contain a label for the task)
        - partially_annotated: Some ROIs for this task do not contain labels, other ones do
        - none: No label is present for this task
      - Video:
        - all tasks are set to null
      "
