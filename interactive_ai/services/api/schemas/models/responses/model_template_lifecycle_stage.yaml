description: |-
  The current support status of the model architecture. 'Active' algorithms are fully supported and maintained. 
  'Deprecated' ones are still supported, but not recommended for training; in a later version, they may be
  discontinued and become 'obsolete', which means that new models cannot be trained with such algorithms.
