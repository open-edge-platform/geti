## Development Guidelines

### Project Overview

IntelÂ® Getiâ„¢ project is a monorepo designed to support independent development and release of multiple related
subprojects while maintaining a cohesive platform. Our architecture allows for flexible and modular development across
different components.

### Repository Structure

#### Directory Layout

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile.shared-*             # Shared build targets for different languages (go, js, python)
â”œâ”€â”€ interactive_ai/               # Group of components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/                 # Group-specific libraries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/                # Nested group of components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ libs/                     # Nested group of components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ makefile                  # Group-level build orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ libs/                         # Cross-project shared libraries
â””â”€â”€ makefile                      # Project-level build orchestration
```

#### Component Structure

Each component typically includes:

- `app/`: Source code
- `chart/`: Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- `Dockerfile`: Container build specifications
- `makefile`: Component-specific build targets
- `version`: Component version tracking file

#### Library Types

1. **Group-Specific Libraries**
    - Scoped to specific service groups
    - Minimize rebuild dependencies
    - Prevent unnecessary cross-component coupling

2. **Cross-Project Libraries**
    - Shared across entire monorepo
    - Kept minimal to reduce rebuild impact
    - Contains universal utilities and shared resources

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Local Kubernetes cluster (kind, k3s, or minikube)
- Docker
- Helm (v3+)
- kubectl
- make (optional)

#### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your local Kubernetes environment (TBD)
3. Configure local Docker registry (TBD)

### Local Development

#### Building a project or component

```bash
# Navigate to the component directory
cd path/to/component

# Build the component
make build-image

# Run tests
make tests
```

#### Build Targets

- `clean`: Remove build artifacts
- `lint`: Run linter in "fix" mode to automatically correct code where possible
- `static-code-analysis`: Run static analysis/linters in read-only mode
- `test-unit`: Run unit tests
- `test-integration`: Run integration tests
- `test-component`: Run component-specific tests
- `test`: Run all types of tests
- `coverage`: Run tests and generate a coverage profile
- `build`: Create binaries
- `publish`: Publish artifacts to registries
- `build-image`: Build a container image
- `build-chart`: Build a helm chart
- `publish-image`: Publish a container image
- `lint-chart`: Lint a helm chart
- `clean-chart`: Clean built charts
- `publish-chart`: Publish a helm chart

## Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise
have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
