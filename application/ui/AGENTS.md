# Geti UI Agent Guide

Component guide for `application/ui/` — the React + TypeScript frontend. Read this
together with the repo-wide `../../AGENTS.md` and the matching skill
`.agents/skills/geti-ui-dev/`.

## What This Component Is

- React 19 + TypeScript single-page app, bundled with RSBuild.
- Also packaged as a desktop app via Tauri (`src-tauri/`).
- Node `>=24.2.0`, npm `>=11.14.0`.
- Talks to the `geti` backend through a generated, typed API client.

## Vendored `@geti` Packages

- `packages/config`, `packages/smart-tools`, and `packages/ui` are cloned by the
  `preinstall` / `npm run clone-geti-ui-packages` hook.
- **Do not edit these locally** — they are overwritten on install.

## Data Fetching & API Types

- Server state goes through **React Query** (`useQuery` / `useMutation`). Never call
  `fetch` / `axios` directly from components, and do not add another data-fetching
  library.
- **API types are generated** from the backend OpenAPI spec:
    - `src/api/openapi-spec.json` — the spec.
    - `src/api/openapi-spec.d.ts` — generated TypeScript types (**never hand-edit**).
- Only `src/constants/shared-types.ts` and the client-building layer (`src/api/**`, `src/query-client/**`) may import types from `src/api/openapi-spec.d.ts` directly; everywhere else, import domain types from `src/constants/shared-types.ts`.
- Regenerate types with:
    - `npm run update-spec` — pull the spec from a running backend on `:7860`, then rebuild types.
    - `npm run build:api` — rebuild types from an existing local `openapi-spec.json`.
- When the backend contract changes, use the `geti-openapi-sync` skill and keep the
  generated spec, generated `.d.ts`, and consuming UI changes in one change set.

## Conventions

- TypeScript: no `any` — use `unknown` and narrow.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, and compose them with `extends` instead of
  `type` intersections (`A & B`): interfaces flatten to a single object type, catch
  property conflicts, display better in errors, and let the compiler cache type
  relationships.
- Use `type` for what an interface can't express: unions, tuples, function
  signatures, and mapped/conditional or other computed types. Give a complex or
  reused computed type a named `type` alias so the compiler can cache the result.
- Function components + hooks only. Co-locate styles as CSS Modules
  (`*.module.scss`); do not add CSS-in-JS beyond what `@geti/ui` already uses.
- Group new code by feature under `src/features/` or share it via `src/components/`,
  `src/hooks/`, or `src/shared/`.
- New backend endpoints need a corresponding mock handler under `mocks/` — reuse
  existing handlers.

## Testing

- Unit tests sit next to source as `*.test.ts(x)` and run under Vitest.
- Component and E2E tests live under `tests/` and run under Playwright.
- Only reach for component/E2E tests when the change affects rendered browser
  behavior.

## Commands

## Guardrails

- Do not hand-edit generated API types.
- Do not edit vendored `packages/*` — they are overwritten.
- Do not introduce another data-fetching or CSS-in-JS library.
- See `application/ui/README.md` for detailed architecture, API integration
  examples, and contributing guidelines.
