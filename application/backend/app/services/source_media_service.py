        Store an uploaded video file using a high-speed threaded block copy.

        A new UUID subdirectory is created under the configured source media root, and the
        incoming file stream is written to a file with the given filename inside it. The
        file copy operation is offloaded to a worker thread using AnyIO to prevent blocking
        the main asynchronous event loop.

        Args:
            filename: Target filename of the uploaded video within its dedicated subdirectory.
                Only the final path component is used, so any directory separators or
                traversal segments (e.g. '../../etc/passwd.mp4') are stripped.
            file_obj: A readable binary stream (such as SpooledTemporaryFile) containing the
